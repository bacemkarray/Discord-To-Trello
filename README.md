# Discord-To-Trello

This project utilizes the Discord API to connect a Discord bot to a server and wait until a message in a channel has a reaction added or removed to it, where it will then scrape the necessary data in the message content using regular expressions. The Trello API is then used to create cards to organize all of the data.
